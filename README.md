# Spotify Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project implements a recommendation system for Spotify, utilizing similarity analysis to suggest songs based on user preferences. The system includes a web scraping component to gather data, a preprocessing step to generate the similarity file, and a deployment script to make the recommendations accessible through a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Song Recommendation:** Suggests songs based on user inputs and preferences.
- **Similarity Analysis:** Uses a precomputed similarity file for efficient recommendations.
- **Web Scraping:** Collects song data, including metadata and audio features, from Spotify or similar platforms.
- **Deployment Ready:** Includes deployment scripts for running the project in a local or online environment.

## Data Collection

The data used for this project is collected through a web scraping script:

1. **Web Scraping:**
   - A Python script (`scraper.py`) is used to scrape song data from online sources.
   - The script gathers song titles, artist names, genres, and audio features (e.g., tempo, energy, danceability).

2. **Data Storage:**
   - The scraped data is stored in a structured CSV file (`songs_data.csv`) for further processing.

3. **Preprocessing:**
   - The data is cleaned and processed to ensure consistency.
   - A similarity matrix is computed based on audio features, and the result is saved as `similarity.pkl` for use in the recommendation system.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or above**
- **Required Libraries:** Listed in `requirements.txt`
- **Similarity File:** Ensure the similarity file (`similarity.pkl`) is included in the project directory. This file is essential for the system to function.

## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ziad-Shalaby/Spotify-Recommendation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Spotify-Recommendation
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment:**

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     env\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source env/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the web scraping script (optional):**

   If you need to scrape new data:

   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

   Ensure the output CSV file is saved in the project directory.

2. **Generate the similarity file (if needed):**

   If the similarity file is not present or needs to be updated:

   ```bash
   python generate_similarity.py
   ```

3. **Run the project:**

   Make sure the similarity file (`similarity.pkl`) is present in the project directory. Then, execute the deployment script:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the application:**

   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to interact with the recommendation system.
